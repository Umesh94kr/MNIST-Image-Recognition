# MNIST-Image-Recognition
We are going to use Deep Neural Network to built a model which fits the images of handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9 ans then recognize them.

# MNIST Dataset
It is an Online large database of handwritten images of digits, it consist of multiple images of a digits written in different styles, blur and distorted.

The MNIST dataset is a multiclass dataset, which consists of 10 classes into which we can classify numbers from zero to nine.
MNIST dataset comes in the form of image of 28 x 28 pixels.
It means that a single image in MNIST dataset have 28 X 28 = 784 pixels or we can say it features.
It means that 28 x 28 image can be any random combination of brightness Values.

# View of Neural Network
--> It will have an input layer containing 784 notes, a few hidden layers that feed forward the input values.

--> finally an output layer containing 10 nodes for each of the respective handwritten numbers.
